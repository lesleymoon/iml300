    <h2>My calm home</h2>
    Home is familiar. But what's familiar to me may not be familiar to you.
    <br />
    Home is not the House... Or is it the Memorable
    <a href="page-8.html">Emotions</a>?
    <br />
    That make up my home.

    <br />
    <a href="page-5.html">I need to go home?</a> I'm telling you this is my
    home.
    <br />
    A memory I can always come back to... not limited by time or space.

    <br />
