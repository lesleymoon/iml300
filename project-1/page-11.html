      Six in 10 people with dementia will wander at least once
      <br />
      (well, according to the Alzheimer’s Association).
      <br />
      Those with dementia may wander for different reasons,
      <br />
      whether it’s looking for something from the past
      <br />
      or wanting to go home.
