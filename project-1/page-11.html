    <h2>Wandering</h2>
    <br />
    Six in 10 people with dementia will wander at least once (well, according to
    the Alzheimer’s Association).
    <br />
    Those with dementia may wander for different reasons, whether it’s looking
    for something from the past or wanting to go home.
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    This saying may be a sign that they are at risk of
    <a href="page-3.html">wandering</a>.
