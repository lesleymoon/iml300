[HOME](https://lesleymoon.github.io/iml300/project-1/) is an interactive web experience that replicates the wandering of Alzheimer's patients and their journey to find home.

### Description

_Where is home?_
A non-linear narrative to finding your way home… but where is home? As the user explores their way through the different pathways or links, they will experience the confusion and uncertainty that people living with Alzehimer’s experience when trying to find their way home.

_What is home?_
Home is explored through the journey to find the tangible structure, but the user unexpectedly comes across personal memories or nonexistent “homes” that bring about homelike emotions. The purpose is to challenge the concept of home as a physical house and as emotions and feelings.

_Who is home?_
“Home is a container of life.” How you define what brings life to your home is special to you. For me, it is not only the physical space or objects that define home but also the people or traces of people that I find central to home. When you start forgetting your loved ones and the people around you, do you start losing your home?
