      Patients with Alzheimerâ€™s will say this over and
      <br />
      over again, even when they are already at home.
      <br />
      But what is home to them? Asking to go home doesn't always mean
      <br />
      returning to the house itself but the sense of home.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Home can mean a time of memorable, emotional memories. An inexistent
      space.
      <br />
      <br />
      Home does not mean the present. So when does home exist?
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Dementia causes time-shifting, which happens when short-term
      <br />
      memory is damaged. Long-term memory is relied on instead
      <br />
      to make sense of the present, causing one to live in the past.
