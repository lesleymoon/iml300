    "I want to go home."
    <br />
    <br />
    Patients with Alzheimerâ€™s will say this over and over again, even when they
    are already at home.
    <br />
    But what is home to them? Asking to go home does not always mean returning
    to the house itself but the sense of home.
    <br />
    <br />
    Home can mean a time of memorable, emotional memories. An inexistent space.
    <br />
    <br />
    Home does not mean the present. So when does home exist?
    <br />
    Dementia causes time-shifting, which happens when short-term memory is
    damaged and long-term memory is relied on
    <br />
    instead to make sense of the present.
    <br />

    "Home is a container of life. Home is a state of mind."
    <br />
    <br />
    Forget and go back home?
