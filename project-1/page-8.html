    <h2>My happy home</h2>

    Home is anywhere my heart is.
    <br />
    It is places I may not frequent but remember longer than places I dwell in.
    <br />
    <br />
    Home is not singular.

    <br />
    It is the people I love. The emotions I feel.
    <br />
    Safe, happy, warm. Comfortable, relaxed, calm.
    <br />
    <br />
    "There you are."
