      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <br>
      Maybe it’s because I grew up while using the Internet but even the start of Odell’s article explaining how there were videos introducing the Internet at its beginning stages was super intriguing to me. For the people of the past, the efficiency of the Internet was only a convenience (such as the E-mail), which has now evolved into numerous issues regarding labor, communication, and your mental state. The progression of the Internet is not something to be considered as negative but ever-changing. Odell brings up the replacement of “How to Use the Internet” videos with “How to” videos explaining everything but the Internet. These informal videos by normal people are again replaced by modern influencers uploading commercials with “convenient” product links. Odell’s discussion of the Internet as a superhighway is relatable—I always have my own looped course of online places but never really thought about how other people do too. Overall, Odell dips into various points about the evolution of Internet interactions, which I all honestly found to be thought-provoking topics that existed but were not explicitly discussed. There now is no longer a “How to Internet” beyond the technicalities, as the Internet is always evolving because of the people.
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Where do you find “normal” strangers on the Internet (not influencers) to exchange random informal interactions (besides social media)?
      <br>
      2. How do you, or do you even, act differently online versus in real life (in terms of persona and etiquette)? What causes such differences?
      <br>
      3. Do you use the Internet to find what you want (Odell brings up safe space, comfort, and affirmation for “facts”) or do you have no purpose?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <br>
      I think I found this reading to be super eye opening because it touches upon a global view of virtual access and what it can do, especially in the context of movements. The way Egyptians used their social media, Web, and media to document these historical events in 2011 was a progressive feat, but it was the maintenance of circulating these documentation that posed a problem. Lara Baladi introduces her archival project Vox Populi to keep the documentary of the revolution alive through screenings at Tahrir Cinema, but the surprising part was the fact that many saw these viral videos from the archive for the very first time. The art revolution that follows freedom from censorship leads to the birth of communities and web-platforms, many of which were archiving projects, but the restrictions on these spaces increased in 2013 and resulted in even more artistic oppression on expression. Thus, it is so important and significant to keep these dead archives alive and to keep them in circulation in order to revive their stories and to reach the people! Paul Soulellis also talks about resisting conventional ideas, and I really enjoyed learning about design justice and how it moves in marginalized communities. Also, his point about design and technology becoming more accurate in identification reminds me of CV Dazzle, which is a concept that fights against surveillance using make-up to conceal human features. https://cvdazzle.com/
      <br>
      <br>
      1. How can we as users of the Web stay vigilant in consuming and sharing archives or history in contrast to current events?
      <br>
      2. If you were to participate in a revolution through media, how would you keep your documentary alive?
      <br>  
      3. What methods are there to revitalize archival projects on social media and through screenings that can be as successful as Baladi’s?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <br>
      I want to first say that I am shocked how men took over the field of computers and started communities that prevented hiring women from these jobs as the salary increased (and how the film industry did the same too!). There are a lot more factors that play into the Web that I’ve never thought about before that was discussed, like the gender roles and even the specifics about how the Internet works. The fact that the Internet is really a power structure and how big corporations are defining the Web right now is a little scary but makes me realize how important our usage is as users of the Internet. I knew about the cables running under the water after watching a TikTok on it, but it was really nice to see a more detailed explanation about how the Internet really works (although I do think I will have to rewatch that 5 minute video again in order to really understand all the different parts that contribute to the working Internet).
      <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <br>
      The first model of the graphical user interface (GUI) emerged from Stanford’s Research Institute (SRI) in 1968 with the help of funds from the national defense department, which brought about a clickable interface with a cursor. Apple then popularized the use of GUI, mouse, and ethernet with their devices after giving some stocks to XeroxPARC, which consisted of many SRI employees. Thus began the use of computers by the general public, but it is important to note that the industry is still white and that there is a history of racial discrimination behind the shift from black computer screen monitors to white for a universal application of default (kudos to American Artist for making the background of their article black, which I just realized the reason for doing so). The article also further discusses how the development of gooey was to create an accessible computer, which split the roles into user and programmer. 
Olia Lialina explains that user experience seems to be getting poorer when defining their experience as more creatively interactive rather than today’s definition as easy and fast. When discussing UX, even the creator of the term, Don Norman, says that the word is starting to lose its meaning as it is used more. Lialina discusses user illusion and how “experience” now means to “hide the programmability” and “customizability of the system” in order to minimize the users’ interactions and create an illusion of natural space. It’s interesting to see the “Wake-up Light” that represents experience as the effect it produces rather than its looks or interactions. I really like the quote from Marc Hassenzahl: “We will inevitably act through products, a story will be told, but the product itself creates and shapes it. The designer becomes an ‘author’ creating rather than representing experiences.” The designer stages the user’s experience but ultimately, the user will tell their story (it’s just what type of story will be told is prompted by the product).
“Every victory of experience design: a new product “telling the story,” or an interface meeting the “exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother” widens the gap in between a person and a personal computer.”
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Is user experience today taking away the user’s storytelling or enhancing their ease to story tell? What are the implications of staging experiences and what separates user illusion from usability?
      <br>
      2. Does your stance on dark mode versus light mode change after hearing about the history behind the white screen or do you see it as merely a way to control eye strain?
      <br>
      3. What are your moral and ethical thoughts on the desktopization of war in terms of both easing soldiers from PTSD and dehumanizing victims into simple graphics?
<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <br>
      “I steal DNA from strangers” really probed an idea I always was wondering about whenever I saw random strangers’ hair strands, chewed gum (Seattle gum wall has too many), and cigarette butts on the street. Heather Dewey-Hagborg takes on the blurred legal line of genetic surveillance to use DNA information to 3-D print faces based on genetic factors. She also challenges the idea of the government using our DNA for surveillance and even how DNA from babies are collected (and stored for who knows how long). Honestly when she introduced her product “Invisible,” I was surprised because I never knew that existed and that in itself supports her claim about our ignorance towards protecting our DNA and genetic information. I really enjoyed Lauren McCarthy’s project “Following” specifically because she plays on a fun idea where people were able to submit a form to explain why they should or want to be followed. She then follows them for a day but not too close to be seen until they are notified that they are no longer being followed. I find bringing the concept of “followers,” a term associated with social media, into reality and a physical space really refreshing because I often think about how social media seems to desensitize the actual connection of “followers” as individual people watching moments of your life. Sydette Harry addresses the abusive surveillance of Black women and the erasure of them, especially when looking at the “Big Booty” era that failed to both credit Black women and discuss the historical criticism they faced for their body types. When Black women do succeed in the media, like Shonda Rhimes, racist critics use her visibility to ignorantly criticize her (for example, Alessandra Stanley’s ignorant comment about how Rhime’s works are “terrorizing” and “sassy” that relies on empty surveillance of Rhime). Harry redefines surveillance as not only a means through technology but also through other cultural forms of monitoring. 
      <br>
      <br>
      1. At what point does it become a privilege to not be followed in a society that values influencers and accounts with thousands of followers?
      <br>
      2. How do you see surveillance in the world shifting with the pandemic where “most” people wear masks? Or how have you seen it shifted (ex. face recognition AI)?
      <br>
      3. Who controls the rules and regulations of legal surveillance, even if information is not published? Is it the people in power or the general public? 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 6</h2>
      <br>
      An Xiao Mina starts off with the Cute Cat Theory, which was really cool to hear about and how censoring the Internet with activist messages would be censoring the same Internet with amateur media, which would ultimately upset more people than intended. Activist messages in China would try to bypass censorship by embedding their messages in cute cats! Mina addresses what memes are through the definitions of multiple people, one being Limor Shifman who defines memes as a group of digital items that share common characteristics, were created with knowledge of each other as a social experience, and were circulated and transformed by multiple users on the Internet. Memes are not just seen as digital objects that are short-lived but as intersections with larger media discourses (#BlackLivesMatter and political references that are remixed like #MAGA). Rosa Menkman talks of interrupting the static with what is known as glitch, which produces noise in the perfection (noise symbolically being anything that is unaccepted). The glitch can be seen as a distraction from the original form or as a reinterpretation that lets in on (what Menkman calls) a personal moment of technology and the intimacy of a computer’s flaw. Once it is seen as a reinterpretation, glitch becomes an art form where multiple factors (the audience, software, etc.) influence its existence in multiple systems, but it’s interesting to note that designing a glitch means to “domesticate” it.
      Hito Steyerl comments on the poor image as something based on a visual idea that strives to be imperfect rather than perfect and original. Because high resolution and specific qualifications of what cinemas wanted were set, resistant visual forms were swept under the rug and unseen from the general public. It was when video streaming was made available that they resurfaced and began to recirculate with many being pirated, leading to privatization and cycling the process of appropriation once more. Other than the poor image, imperfect cinema is also discussed as merging life with art and users are not only responsible for circulation, but for the production of poor images and cinema as well. “Poor images are… popular images.”
    <br>
    <br>
      1. The creation of the poor image can be a natural process that deteriorates quality with more and more circulation and contributors, but how do you view poor images that are deliberately reduced by one user?
      <br>
      2. How do you view the function in Procreate that deliberately allows one to add glitch to their art (and to even control the % of it)?
      <br>
      3. What is a trend of memes you see right now that reflects media discourse?
      <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 7</h2>
      <br>
      Joy Buolamwini talks about the “coded gaze” (or algorithmic bias), which is a huge problem in global society because of its massive and immediate reach. Buolamwini speaks of her own experiences where the social robot could not recognize her face unless she wore a white mask and faced the same experience abroad. This problem can be addressed with more diverse training sets through machine learning, which is important to prevent the exclusion of certain populations. Another problem is the mislabeling of faces that police can use from facial recognition software in their criminal arrests and discriminatory practices. “Who codes matters, How we code matters, Why we code matters” are all ways in which we as society can ensure that there is inclusion and no discrimination in the computation of programs that affect society, such as predictive policing and machine-learning risk scores. Mimi Onuoha talks about Pathways, her project in data collection and people’s subjectivity to it by collecting their mobile data. She discusses that Pathways is different from how data collection usually happens (data is collected from the subject unknowingly) and the interactions she had with the subjects. 
      She concludes that “if you haven’t considered the collection process, you haven’t considered the data,” meaning that without her interactions with each group, it would not have been the same data collection. Stephanie Dinkins speaks of the internal algorithm by introducing Afro-now-ism, a technology to resist systemic oppression and for Black people to free their minds from obstructions that limit them to what America has put in place. She speaks of the future of AI in establishing equity and governance with direct input of the public. 
      <br>
      <br>
      1. We all know about facial recognition and its role in advertising by scanning your facial expressions. Do you see certain cultural features being included in how facial recognition software interprets facial expressions?
      <br>
      2. Similar to Onuoha’s Pathways project, who would you like to see your data visualized with (family, friends, etc.)? Would you be more willing to have your data collected by an individual or by a corporation and what does that mean to you? 
      <br>
      3. What do you think of TikTok’s biometric data collection, which collects faceprints, voiceprints, and behavioral characteristics?  
      <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 8</h2>
      <br>
      Morehshin Allhyari speaks on art activism and her own practice when considering using art in a way that is not just aesthetically pleasing and that speaks about issues of the art world but also addresses social and economical problems. She talks about Iran and its banning and censorship of certain objects to prevent Western media and the viral video of ISIS destroying artifacts, which was documented, edited, and posted on social media by ISIS to exaggerate and spread their violent beliefs. Allhyari also explains the difficulties she faced trying to recreate these destroyed artifacts to 3D print them, saying that information and images of the artifacts were not accessible, hard to obtain, and misinterpreted through multiple languages. Olivia Ross introduces the topic of re-indigenization and non-violent creative coding, which keeps violence from affecting the land, the people, and the community. I did not know that the World Report on Violence and Health presented a typology of violence, which is a progressive step to being more mindful about the different effects of violence! Yaa Addae talks about data healing, and the article references "Algorithms of Oppression," which digs into the deeper issues of the algorithm and its racial bias that stems from the creators of such technologies and software. From Google search engines to practices of redlining, data discrimination is connected to how people in real life perceive and think about certain races and how they are treated, which is why attention and accessibility to resources to learn about technology are so important. 
      <br>
      <br>
      1. How can we hold big tech corporations accountable for biased algorithms? Do you think they should censor harmful and stereotypical search engine suggestions?
      <br>
      2. What do you think about ISIS utilizing social media to spread propaganda and acts of violence against artifacts? 
      <br>
      3. How do you hold yourself accountable to make nonviolent creative coding in this class (and for the future)?
      <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <br>
    I chose to read “World White Web” from the Cyberfeminism index, which addresses the white bias of the Google search engine and the needed change to fix the discriminatory search results. Searching “hand” on Google and seeing mostly white hands is one example that World White Web focuses on, and their website allows users to share and download diverse colored hand images from Google to increase their rankings and change the search results. In Ari Melenciano’s talk about “Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Features,” Melenciano emphasizes the need to question the status quo and what is traditionally taught in design, the role of the designer, and ways to design sustainably and respectfully. It is important to design with and not for the community, especially with the savior complex that can limit the learning of other cultures and traditions. In the interview with Hamid Khan about his fight towards dismantling racist police surveillance, he explains the biased algorithms that target tracking poor, queer, and minority communities that store and collect information to use as social control. In terms of how predictive policing was carried out, there was a risk assessment tool used to track certain individuals with points who were then surveilled and watched (it was discontinued, but different programs of policing were carried out after). 
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Are there any other ways or productive practices that we as users can do to reduce discriminatory search results on Google besides increasing image rankings?
    <br>
    2. How do you see yourself creating beyond human-centered designs and for the environment? What do you think about Apple’s linear design that profits off of obsoletion/waste?
    <br>
    3. Do you think predictive policing and racist algorithms for surveillance are known topics by the public or do you think there should be more resources to inform society about these topics?
