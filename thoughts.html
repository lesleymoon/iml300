      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <br>
      
      Maybe it’s because I grew up while using the Internet but even the start of Odell’s article explaining how there were videos introducing the Internet at its beginning stages was super intriguing to me. For the people of the past, the efficiency of the Internet was only a convenience (such as the E-mail), which has now evolved into numerous issues regarding labor, communication, and your mental state. The progression of the Internet is not something to be considered as negative but ever-changing. Odell brings up the replacement of “How to Use the Internet” videos with “How to” videos explaining everything but the Internet. These informal videos by normal people are again replaced by modern influencers uploading commercials with “convenient” product links. Odell’s discussion of the Internet as a superhighway is relatable—I always have my own looped course of online places but never really thought about how other people do too. Overall, Odell dips into various points about the evolution of Internet interactions, which I all honestly found to be thought-provoking topics that existed but were not explicitly discussed. There now is no longer a “How to Internet” beyond the technicalities, as the Internet is always evolving because of the people.
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Where do you find “normal” strangers on the Internet (not influencers) to exchange random informal interactions (besides social media)?
      2. How do you, or do you even, act differently online versus in real life (in terms of persona and etiquette)? What causes such differences?
      3. Do you use the Internet to find what you want (Odell brings up safe space, comfort, and affirmation for “facts”) or do you have no purpose?
    <br>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <br>
      I think I found this reading to be super eye opening because it touches upon a global view of virtual access and what it can do, especially in the context of movements. The way Egyptians used their social media, Web, and media to document these historical events in 2011 was a progressive feat, but it was the maintenance of circulating these documentation that posed a problem. Lara Baladi introduces her archival project Vox Populi to keep the documentary of the revolution alive through screenings at Tahrir Cinema, but the surprising part was the fact that many saw these viral videos from the archive for the very first time. The art revolution that follows freedom from censorship leads to the birth of communities and web-platforms, many of which were archiving projects, but the restrictions on these spaces increased in 2013 and resulted in even more artistic oppression on expression. Thus, it is so important and significant to keep these dead archives alive and to keep them in circulation in order to revive their stories and to reach the people! Paul Soulellis also talks about resisting conventional ideas, and I really enjoyed learning about design justice and how it moves in marginalized communities. Also, his point about design and technology becoming more accurate in identification reminds me of CV Dazzle, which is a concept that fights against surveillance using make-up to conceal human features. https://cvdazzle.com/
      <br>
      <br>
      1. How can we as users of the Web stay vigilant in consuming and sharing archives or history in contrast to current events?
2. If you were to participate in a revolution through media, how would you keep your documentary alive?
3. What methods are there to revitalize archival projects on social media and through screenings that can be as successful as Baladi’s?

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <br>
      I want to first say that I am shocked how men took over the field of computers and started communities that prevented hiring women from these jobs as the salary increased (and how the film industry did the same too!). There are a lot more factors that play into the Web that I’ve never thought about before that was discussed, like the gender roles and even the specifics about how the Internet works. The fact that the Internet is really a power structure and how big corporations are defining the Web right now is a little scary but makes me realize how important our usage is as users of the Internet. I knew about the cables running under the water after watching a TikTok on it, but it was really nice to see a more detailed explanation about how the Internet really works (although I do think I will have to rewatch that 5 minute video again in order to really understand all the different parts that contribute to the working Internet).

    <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <br>
      The first model of the graphical user interface (GUI) emerged from Stanford’s Research Institute (SRI) in 1968 with the help of funds from the national defense department, which brought about a clickable interface with a cursor. Apple then popularized the use of GUI, mouse, and ethernet with their devices after giving some stocks to XeroxPARC, which consisted of many SRI employees. Thus began the use of computers by the general public, but it is important to note that the industry is still white and that there is a history of racial discrimination behind the shift from black computer screen monitors to white for a universal application of default (kudos to American Artist for making the background of their article black, which I just realized the reason for doing so). The article also further discusses how the development of gooey was to create an accessible computer, which split the roles into user and programmer. 
Olia Lialina explains that user experience seems to be getting poorer when defining their experience as more creatively interactive rather than today’s definition as easy and fast. When discussing UX, even the creator of the term, Don Norman, says that the word is starting to lose its meaning as it is used more. Lialina discusses user illusion and how “experience” now means to “hide the programmability” and “customizability of the system” in order to minimize the users’ interactions and create an illusion of natural space. It’s interesting to see the “Wake-up Light” that represents experience as the effect it produces rather than its looks or interactions. I really like the quote from Marc Hassenzahl: “We will inevitably act through products, a story will be told, but the product itself creates and shapes it. The designer becomes an ‘author’ creating rather than representing experiences.” The designer stages the user’s experience but ultimately, the user will tell their story (it’s just what type of story will be told is prompted by the product).
“Every victory of experience design: a new product “telling the story,” or an interface meeting the “exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother” widens the gap in between a person and a personal computer.”


      <br>
      <br>
      1. Is user experience today taking away the user’s storytelling or enhancing their ease to story tell? What are the implications of staging experiences and what separates user illusion from usability?
2. Does your stance on dark mode versus light mode change after hearing about the history behind the white screen or do you see it as merely a way to control eye strain?
3. What are your moral and ethical thoughts on the desktopization of war in terms of both easing soldiers from PTSD and dehumanizing victims into simple graphics?
